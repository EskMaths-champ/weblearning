        <p>As soon as a new car leaves the dealership, its value decreases and it is considered “second-hand”. Vehicles, equipment, machinery and other similar assets, all lose value over time as a result of usage and age. This loss in value is called depreciation. Assets that have a relatively long useful lifetime, such as machines, trucks, farming equipment etc., depreciate slower than assets like office equipment, computers, furniture etc. which need to be replaced more often and therefore depreciate more quickly.
<br>
Depreciation is used to calculate the value of a company's assets, which determines how much tax a company must pay. Companies can take depreciation into account as an expense, and thereby reduce their taxable income. A lower taxable income means that the company will pay less income tax to SARS (South African Revenue Service).
<br>
We can calculate two different kinds of depreciation: simple decay and compound decay. Decay is also a term used to describe a reduction or decline in value. Simple decay is also called straight-line depreciation and compound decay can also be referred to as reducing-balance depreciation. In the straight-line method the value of the asset is reduced by a constant amount each year, which is calculated on the principal amount. In reducing-balance depreciation we calculate the depreciation on the reduced value of the asset. This means that the value of an asset decreases by a different amount each year.</p><br>

      <p>Therefore the depreciated value of the asset (also called the book value) can be calculated as:
<br>
\( A=P(1−in) \)
<br>
Note the similarity to the simple interest formula \( A=P(1+in) \). Interest increases the value of the principal amount, whereas with simple decay, depreciation reduces the value of the principal amount.

<b>Important:</b>to get an accurate answer do all calculations in one step on your calculator. Do not round off answers in your calculations until the final answer. In the worked examples in this chapter, we use dots to show that the answer has not been rounded off. We always round the final answer to two decimal places (cents).</p>
