        <p>
           <b>Intuitive Curve Fitting</b><br>In Grade 11, we used various means, such as histograms, frequency polygons and ogives, to visualise our data. These are very useful tools to depict univariate data, i.e. data with only one variable such as the height of learners in a class.<br>Last year we also learnt about a visual tool called scatter plots. Scatter plots are a common way to visualise bivariate data, i.e. data with two variables. This allows us to identify the direction and strength of a relationship between two variables.<br>We identify the nature of a relationship between two variables by examining if the points on the scatter plot conform to a linear, exponential, quadratic or some other function. The process of fitting functions to data is known as curve fitting.<br>
The strength of a relationship can be described as strong if the data points conform closely to a function or weak if they are further away.<br>In the case of linear functions, the direction of a relationship is positive if high values of one variable occur with high values of the other or negative if high values of one variable occur with low values of the other.<br>The table below summarises the different relationships:<br>

         <p><b>Interpolation and extrapolation</b>
<br>
When we predict values that fall within the range of our data, this is known as <b>interpolation</b>. When we predict the values of a variable beyond the range of our data, this is known as extrapolation.
<br>
Extrapolation must be done with caution unless it is known that the observed relationship continues beyond the range of our data. For example, an exponential function may look linear if we only have the first few data points available but if we extrapolate far enough beyond the initial data points, our predictions will be inaccurate.
<br>
In order to interpolate or extrapolate values, we need to find the equation of the function which best fits the data. For linear data, we draw a straight line through the data which best approximates the available data points. This line is known as the <b>line of best fit</b> or trend line. Let us try our hand at this in the following example.
