      <p>In this chapter, we apply mathematical skills to everyday financial situations.

If you had R1 000, you could either keep it in your piggy bank, or deposit it into a bank account. If you deposit the money into a bank account, you are effectively lending money to the bank. Because you are lending the bank money, you can expect some extra money back. This is known as interest. Similarly, 

if you borrow money from a bank, then you can expect to pay interest on the loan. Interest is charged at a percentage of the money owed over the period of time it takes to pay back the loan. This means that the longer the loan exists, the more interest will have to be paid on it.</p>

   <p>The concept is simple, yet it is core to the world of finance. Accountants, actuaries and bankers can spend their entire working career dealing with the effects of interest on financial matters.</p>

   <h2>Simple Interest</h2>

   <p>Simple interest is interest calculated only on the initial amount that you invested.
As an easy example of simple interest, consider how much we will get by investing R1 000 for 1 year with a bank that pays 5% p.a. simple interest.

At the end of the year we have</p

   <h2>Interest = R 1 000 × 5% </h2>

   <h3>= R 1 000 × 5/100</h3>

   <h3>= R 1 000 × 0,05</h3>

   <h3>= R 50</h3>

   <p>With an opening balance of R1 000 at the start of the year, the closing balance at the end of the year will therefore be</p>

   <h3>Closing balance = Opening + Interest</h3>

   <h3>= R 1000 + R 50</h3>

   <h3>= R 1 050</h3>

   <p>The opening balance in financial calculations is often called the principal, denoted as P (R1 000 in the example). The interest rate is usually labelled ii (5% p.a. in the example and “p.a.” means per annum or per year). The interest amount is labelled II (R50 in the example).</p>

   <h3>So we can see that</h3>

   <h3>I=P×i</h3>

   <p>and</p>


   <h3>Closing balance = Opening balance + Interest</h3>

   <h3>= P + I</h3>

   <h3>=P + P × i</h3>

   <h3>= P (1 + i)</h3>

   <p>The above calculations give a good idea of what the simple interest formula looks like. However, the example shows an investment that lasts for only one year. If the investment or loan is over a longer period, we need to take this into account. We use the symbol n to indicate time period, which must be given in years.</p>

   <h3>The general formula for calculating simple interest is</h3>

   <h3>A = P (1 +in)</h3>

   <p>Where:</p>

   <h3>A = accumulated amount (final)</h3>

   <h3>P = principal amount (initial)</h3>

   <h3>i = interest written as decimal</h3>

   <h3>n = number of years</h3>

   <p>We can use the simple interest formula to find pieces of missing information. For example, if we have an amount of money that we want to invest for a set amount of time to achieve a goal amount, we can rearrange the variables to solve for the required interest rate. The same principles apply to finding the length of time we would need to invest the money, if we knew the principal and accumulated amounts and the interest rate.

Important: to get a more accurate answer, try to do all your calculations on the calculator in one go. This will prevent rounding off errors from influencing your final answer.</p>
