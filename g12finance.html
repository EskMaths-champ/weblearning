        <p>In this chapter we look at different types of annuities, sinking funds and pyramid schemes. We also look at how to critically analyse investment and loan options and how to make informed financial decisions.<br>

Financial planning is very important and it allows people to achieve certain goals, such as supporting a family, attending university, buying a house, and saving enough money for retirement. Prudent financial planning includes making a budget, opening a savings account, wisely investing savings and planning for retirement.<br><br>

<b>Calculating the Period of the Investment</b>
<br>
For calculations using the simple interest formula, we solve for n, the time period of an investment or loan, by simply rearranging the formula to make n the subject. For compound interest calculations, where n is an exponent in the formula, we need to use our knowledge of logarithms to determine the value of n.</p>
