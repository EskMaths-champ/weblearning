       <p>A rational number QQ is any number which can be written as:
<abab
where aa and bb are intergers and b≠0b≠0.</p>

<p>The following numbers are all rational numbers:
101,217,−1−3,1020,−36101
We see that all numerators and all denominators are intergers
This means that all intergers are rational numbers, because they can be written with a denominator of 11.</p>


 <h2>Irrational Number</h2>
 <p>Irrational Number Q′Q′ are numbers that cannot be wriiten as a fraction with the numerator and denominator as interger
Examples of irrational numbers
2–√,3–√,4–√3,π,1+5√22
Those are not rational numbers, because either the numerator or the denominator is not an interger.</p>
 <br>
 <h2>Decimal Numbers</h2>
 <p>All integers and fractions with integer numerators and non-zero integer denominators are rational numbers. Remember that when the denominator of a fraction is zero then the fraction is undefined.</p
 <br>
 <p>You can write any rational number as a decimal number but not all decimal numbers are rational numbers. These types of decimal numbers are rational numbers:</p

 <p>Decimal numbers that end (or terminated).For example, the fraction 410410 can be written as 0,40,4.</p>

 <p>Decimal numbers that have a repeating single digit.For example, the fraction 1313 can be written as 0,3˙0,3˙ or 0,3¯0,3¯.The dot and bar notations are equivalent and both represent recurring 3′s3′s, i.e.0,3˙=0,3¯=0,333....0,3˙
 <br>=0,3¯
 <br>=0,333...</p
 <br>
 <p>Decimal numbers that havea recurring pattern of multiple digits.For example, the fraction 211211 can also be written as 0,18¯0,18¯.The bar represents a recurring pattern of 1′s1′s and 8′s8′s, i.e.0,18¯
 <br>=0,181818..0,18¯
 <br>=0,181818..</p>
 <br>

 <p>Notation: You can use a dot or a bar over the repeated digits to indicate that the decimal is a recurring decimal. If the bar covers more than one digit, then all numbers beneath the bar are recurring.
If you are asked to identify whether a number is rational or irrational, first write the number in decimal form. If the number terminates then it is rational. If it goes on forever, then look for a repeated pattern of digits. If there is no repeated pattern, then the number is irrational.
When you write irrational numbers in decimal form, you may continue writing them for many, many decimal places. However, this is not convenient and it is often necessary to round off.</p>
 <br>
 <h1>Converting terminating decimal into rational numbers</h2>
 <p>A decimal number has an integer part and a fractional part.For example, 10,58910,589 has an integer part of 1010 and a fractional part of 0,5890,589 because:
 <br>
10+0,589
<br>=10,589>10+0,589
<br>=10,589</p>
 <br>
<p>Each digit after the decimal point is a fraction with a denominator in increasing powers of 1010.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>0,10,1 isa10a10</li>
  <li>0,010,01 isa100a100</li>
  <li>0,0010,001 isa1000a1000</li>
 </ul>
<p>This means that</p>

 <p>Converting recurring decimal into rational numbers
When the decimal is a recurring decimal, a bit more work is needed to write the fractional part of the decimal number as a fraction.
In the first example, the decimal was multiplied by 10 and in the second example, the decimal was multiplied by 1 000. This is because there was only one digit recurring (i.e. 3) in the first example, while there were three digits recurring (i.e. 432) in the second example. In general, if you have one digit recurring, then multiply by 10. If you have two digits recurring, then multiply by 100100. If you have three digits recurring, then multiply by 1 000 and so on.</p>

<p>Not all decimal numbers can be written as rational numbers.Why? Irrational decimal numbers like 2–√
<br>=1,4142135....2
<b></b>=1,4142135.... cannot be written with an integer numerator and denominator, because they do not have a pattern of recurring digits and they do not terminate</p>
